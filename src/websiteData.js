            paragraph: "My name is Georgia Tillotson and I am the creator of Georgia the Naturalist. I have had a passion for nature since I was very young. I would spend most of my summer days outside looking for snakes in my mother’s yard, and going on hikes with my older sister. People would often ask me who my hero was, or who I looked up to, and I would name the naturalist who would do programs on local T.V. I loved going to programming at our zoo and at the state park that was nearest to us, and thus grew my dream to one day become a naturalist myself. ",

My goal with every program is to get someone at least a little bit more excited about learning to love observing the world around them. I want to make sure that when I am leading a program, everyone feels heard and all questions are answered. A program should never be a lecture, but rather a conversation. I am so excited to be starting this business and to share my passion for nature with you! ",
